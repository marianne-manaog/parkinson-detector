# Cassandra and Machine Learning-driven Parkinson's Disease Detector
This repository hosts Python codes to detect Parkinson's Disease leveraging speech data, Apache Cassandra's vector search similarity, and ensembles of Decision Trees.

## Datasets
Five speech-related datasets are used in this project. These files are taken from the University California Irvine
Machine Learning repository (Little, 2008, 2009; Naranjo et al., 2016; Sakar et al., 2013; Sakar et al., 2018) and 
the references are provided in the corresponding sub-section below.

## Setup

* Updating conda

Please update conda by running:

`conda update -n base -c defaults conda`

* Configuration of the environment

Please create a conda virtual environment and install all required dependencies of this application by
running: 

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

* Activating and deactivating the conda environment

To activate this environment, please run:

`conda activate pd_detector`

To deactivate an active environment, please run the following command:

`conda deactivate`
