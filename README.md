# Cassandra and Machine Learning-driven Parkinson's Disease Detector
This repository hosts Python codes to detect Parkinson's Disease leveraging speech data, Apache Cassandra's vector search similarity, and ensembles of Decision Trees.

## Datasets
Five speech-related datasets are used in this project. These files are taken from the University California Irvine
Machine Learning repository (Little, 2008, 2009; Naranjo et al., 2016; Sakar et al., 2013; Sakar et al., 2018) and 
the references are provided in the corresponding sub-section below.
